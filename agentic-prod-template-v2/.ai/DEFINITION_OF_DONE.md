# Definition of Done (v2)

A change is done only if:
1. Build/test checks pass for the changed area.
2. If tests are missing, a concrete test plan is provided.
3. No secrets are added to the repository.
4. Relevant docs/specs/task files are updated when behavior or status changes.
5. Diff stays scoped to requested feature/bug (no unrelated refactors).
6. Rollback risk is called out for non-trivial behavior changes.
