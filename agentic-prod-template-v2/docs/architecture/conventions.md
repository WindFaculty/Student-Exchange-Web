# Coding Conventions (Template)

Workflow conventions:
- Read context docs and active tasks before coding.
- Work on one scoped task unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Keep diffs small and reviewable.
- Update docs/tasks when behavior or status changes.

Quality gates:
- Run build/tests for changed scope.
- Provide a test plan when tests are missing.
- Do not introduce secrets.

Review conventions:
- Cite file paths for behavioral claims.
- Separate findings by severity in reviews.
- Call out migration/rollback risk explicitly.
