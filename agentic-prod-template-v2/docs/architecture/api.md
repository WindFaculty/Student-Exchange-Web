# API Surface Summary (Template)

Document only confirmed contracts.
Do not invent endpoints when implementation is unclear.

Recommended API sections:
- Auth/session
- Core business domain endpoints
- Admin/operations endpoints
- Error model and pagination contract

Canonical API reference should live in your repo root (for example `docs/03-api.md`).
When uncertain, verify against controller/router source files and cite exact paths.
