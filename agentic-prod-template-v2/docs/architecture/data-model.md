# Data Model Snapshot (Template)

Capture only stable entities and relationships relevant to implementation decisions.

Suggested sections:
- Core entities and key fields
- Relationship map
- State enums/status models
- Session/transient models (if applicable)
- Migration strategy (Flyway/Liquibase/etc.)

Canonical references should remain in root architecture and API docs.
