# Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor

This sensor measures soil moisture by sensing capacitance, which avoids corrosion issues common in resistive sensors. It operates from 3.3–5.5 V and outputs an analog voltage inversely proportional to moisture【10603390336420†L100-L109】【10603390336420†L121-L123】.

- **Operating voltage**: 3.3–5.5 V
- **Output**: Analog voltage (lower voltage = wetter soil)
- **Advantages**: Corrosion‑resistant, long‑lasting
- **Interface**: Analog input (ADC)
