# Antigravity Rules (Lite Stateful Dev Kit)

1. One task per session only.
2. Keep diffs small and reviewable.
3. Never introduce dependencies unless required.
4. Always update state files:
   - docs/00-context.md
   - tasks/task-queue.md
   - tasks/done.md
5. If blocked, write the blocker explicitly in docs/00-context.md and mark task BLOCKED.
